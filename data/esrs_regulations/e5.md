19. The description of the resource use and circular economy-related actions and resources allocated shall follow the principles defined in ESRS 2 MDR-A Actions and resources in relation to material sustainability matters.

20. In addition to ESRS 2 MDR-A, the undertaking may specify whether and how an action and resources cover:

	- (a) higher levels of resource efficiency in use of technical and biological materials and water, particularly in relation to critical raw materials and rare earths as listed in the Raw Materials Information System;
	- (b) higher rates of use of secondary raw materials (recyclates);
	- (c) application of circular design, leading to increased product durability and optimization of use, and higher rates of: Reuse, Repair, Refurbishing, Remanufacture, Repurposing and Recycling;
	- (d) application of circular business practices such as 	- (i) value retention actions (maintenance, repair, refurbishing, remanufacturing, component harvesting, upgrading and reverse logistics, closed loop systems, second-hand retailing), (ii) value maximization actions (product-service systems, collaborative and sharing economy business models), (iii) end-of-life actions (recycling, upcycling, extended producer responsibility), and (iv) systems efficiency actions (industrial symbiosis);
	- (e) actions taken to prevent waste generation in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain; and
	- (f) optimization of waste management in line with the waste hierarchy.

## Disclosure Requirement E5-3 – Targets related to resource use and circular economy

21. The undertaking shall disclose the resource use and circular economy-related targets it has set.

22. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the targets the undertaking has adopted to support its resource use and circular economy policy and to address its material impacts, risks and opportunities.

23. The description of the targets shall contain the information requirements defined in ESRS 2 MDR-T Tracking effectiveness of policies and actions through targets. 

24. The disclosure required by paragraph 21 shall indicate whether and how the undertaking’s targets relate to resource inflows and resource outflows, including waste and products and materials, and, more specifically to:

	- (a) the increase of circular product design (including for instance design for durability, dismantling, reparability, recyclability etc); 
	- (b) the increase of circular material use rate;
	- (c) the minimization of primary raw material;
	- (d) sustainable sourcing and use (in line with the cascading principle) of renewable resources;
	- (e) the waste management, including preparation for proper treatment; and
	- (f) other matters related to resource use or circular economy.

25. The undertaking shall specify to which layer of the waste hierarchy the target relates. 

26. In addition to ESRS 2 MDR-T, the undertaking may specify whether ecological thresholds and entity-specific allocations were taken into consideration when setting targets. If so, the undertaking may specify:

	- (a) the ecological thresholds identified, and the methodology used to identify such thresholds;
	- (b) whether or not the thresholds are entity-specific and if so, how they were determined; and
	- (c) how responsibility for respecting identified ecological thresholds is allocated in the undertaking.

27. The undertaking shall specify as part of the contextual information, whether the targets it has set and presented are mandatory (required by legislation) or voluntary.

## Disclosure Requirement E5-4 – Resource inflows

28. The undertaking shall disclose information on its resource inflows related to its material impacts, risks and opportunities. 

29. The objective of this Disclosure Requirement is to enable an understanding of the resource use in the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream value chain. 

30. The disclosure required by paragraph 28 shall include a description of its resource inflows where material: products (including packaging) and materials (specifying critical raw materials and rare earths), water and property, plant and equipment used in the undertaking’s own operations and along its upstream value chain. 

31. When an undertaking assesses that resource inflows is a material sustainability matter, it shall disclose the following information about the materials used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services during the reporting period, in tonnes or kilogrammes: 

	- (a) the overall total weight of products and technical and biological materials used during the reporting period; 
	- (b) the percentage of biological materials (and biofuels used for non-energy purposes) used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services (including packaging) that is sustainably sourced, with the information on the certification scheme used and on the application of the cascading principle; and
